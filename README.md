### 🧠 Approach (200 words)

The Smart Recipe Generator was built with the goal of simplifying daily cooking decisions by using technology to generate recipes based on ingredients users already have. The main idea was to help reduce food waste and make cooking more creative and convenient. Users simply input their available ingredients, and the system suggests possible dishes along with brief cooking instructions.

To achieve this, I focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface that allows quick interaction and delivers instant results. The frontend was designed with responsiveness and minimalism in mind, ensuring it works smoothly across devices. The logic behind the app maps common ingredients to potential recipes using structured data and conditional matching.

I deployed the application using Vercel, which provides a seamless and fast hosting environment for web projects. The app emphasizes usability and accessibility, ensuring that even first-time users can navigate it easily.

Throughout the development process, my focus was on simplicity, functionality, and performance. The Smart Recipe Generator represents how everyday challenges—like deciding what to cook—can be solved creatively using smart web tools. It’s a small but practical example of how intelligent design can make life easier while promoting sustainable habits in the kitchen.
